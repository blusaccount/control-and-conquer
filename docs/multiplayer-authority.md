# Multiplayer Authority Architecture

## Guiding Principle

**The server is the single source of truth for all game state.**
Clients never mutate game state locally; they render the most recent snapshot
received from the server and send intent-only commands.

---

## Components

| Component | File(s) | Responsibility |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **WebSocket server** | `src/Server/index.ts` | Accepts connections, serves static assets, parses messages, runs the tick loop |
| **Command validator** | `src/Server/validateCommand.ts` | Structural validation of raw incoming JSON before it reaches game logic |
| **MatchRegistry** | `src/Server/MatchRegistry.ts` | Drops each client into its own solo match vs a server-side bot; routes intents; ticks all sessions |
| **RasterGameSession** | `src/Server/RasterGameSession.ts` | Owns the authoritative `GameMap` + `TerritoryGrid` + `RasterConflict`; validates intents into the engine's business rules; broadcasts snapshots |
| **RasterConflict** | `src/Core/RasterConflict.ts` | Deterministic, self-contained territorial combat resolution |
| **RasterBotController** | `src/Server/RasterBotController.ts` | Server-side opponent that consumes snapshots and queues expand intents like a human |
| **Client** | `src/Client/rasterClient.ts` | Renders snapshots; emits click-to-expand intents over WebSocket |

## Event Flow

```
Client                              Server
  │                                   │
  │  ── WebSocket connect ──────────► │  MatchRegistry.joinRasterSolo
  │  ◄─ PLAYER_ASSIGNED ───────────── │  assign id/colour, spawn tile
  │  ◄─ SNAPSHOT (with terrain) ───── │  initial snapshot (terrain bytes once)
  │                                   │
  │  User clicks a tile               │
  │  ── CLIENT_RASTER_EXPAND ───────► │  validateCommand(raw)   [shape check]
  │     { targetX, targetY, percent } │  queueExpand            [buffered]
  │                                   │
  │            (server tick boundary) │  validate intent → AttackIntent
  │                                   │  RasterConflict.processTick
  │  ◄─ SNAPSHOT (owner delta) ─────  │  broadcast to subscribers
  │  ◄─ ACTION_REJECTED (if invalid)  │  sent only to the offending client
  │                                   │
  │  ◄─ MATCH_ENDED (on victory) ───  │  broadcast once
```

## Server Responsibilities

1. **Structural validation** (`validateCommand`): the raw JSON must have a known
   `type` discriminant and well-typed fields (integer tile coords ≥ 0, percent
   1..100). Violations produce a `SERVER_RASTER_ACTION_REJECTED` with reason
   `INVALID_MESSAGE_FORMAT`; no state change occurs.

2. **Business-rule validation** (`RasterGameSession.validateAndBuildIntent`):
   the tile must be in bounds and capturable, not already owned by the attacker,
   the attacker must have a frontier touching the target, and the committed
   slice of the pool must be affordable. Failures yield a typed reject reason.

3. **Authoritative state mutation**: only `RasterConflict` (via the session's
   tick) mutates ownership and troop pools. There is no path by which a client
   can influence state except through validated, queued intents.

4. **Broadcast**: after every tick the session sends a full `RasterSnapshot` to
   each subscriber. Static terrain bytes are shipped only on the first snapshot
   per client (keyed by `terrainHash`); subsequent snapshots omit them.

---

## Client Responsibilities

- Render the most recent `RasterSnapshot` (terrain + ownership raster, boats).
- Translate canvas clicks into `CLIENT_RASTER_EXPAND` intents.
- Display reject/victory messages from the server.
- Hold no authoritative state — local fields are purely presentational and are
  overwritten on every snapshot.

## Known Limitations (MVP)

| # | Limitation | Impact |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | **No player identity / auth** — the server trusts the socket; one socket = one solo match. | Fine for solo-vs-bot; real PvP needs identity. |
| 2 | **No reconnection / resync** — a dropped socket ends the match; the terrain cache is keyed by `terrainHash` but there is no session resume. | Reloading starts a fresh match. |
| 3 | **Solo matches only** — every client gets an isolated session vs one bot. There is no shared-session PvP or matchmaking yet. | No human-vs-human. |
| 4 | **Full ownership raster every tick** — the owner array is re-sent each tick (terrain is sent once). Acceptable at current map sizes; delta encoding will matter for larger maps or many players. | Bandwidth scales with map size × tick rate. |
| 5 | **No rate limiting beyond per-tick batching** — intents are buffered and applied at tick boundaries, but there is no per-client action-frequency cap. | Programmatic spam is throttled only by the tick cadence. |

Items 1 and 3 are the highest-priority gaps before real multiplayer.
